# Practice with HTML Heading Sizes

I have been practicing the use of different HTML heading sizes to structure content effectively. Below is a description of how I applied these headings:

- `<h1>` for the main title of the document, "Book."
- `<h2>` for major sections or chapters, like "Chapter 1," "Chapter 2," and "Chapter 3."
- `<h3>` for subsections within each chapter, such as "Section 1" and "Section 2."
- `<h4>` for detailed elements under sections, demonstrated with "Diagram 1" under "Chapter 2, Section 1."

This structured approach helps in organizing content clearly and hierarchically, enhancing readability and navigation.
